# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - lib/assets/images/bg/
    - lib/assets/images/element/

    - lib/assets/images/icons/
    - lib/assets/images/icons/5 main buttons/
    - lib/assets/images/icons/streak/
    - lib/assets/images/icons/ui/
    - lib/assets/images/icons/เมฆ emotion/

    - lib/assets/images/mascot/
    - lib/assets/images/word/
    - lib/assets/images/แต่งตัวnexky/

    # - lib/assets/lang/

    - lib/assets/sounds/chill/
    - lib/assets/sounds/focus/
    - lib/assets/sounds/sleep/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    #   - family: Schyler
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
    #         style: italic
    #   - family: Trajan Pro
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
    #         weight: 700
    - family: Chula Charas New
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Chula/ChulaCharasNewReg.ttf
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Chula/ChulaCharasNewBold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Chula/ChulaCharasNewBoldIta.ttf
          weight: 700
          style: italic
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Chula/ChulaCharasNewIta.ttf
          style: italic
